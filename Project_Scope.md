### Mid-Level Data Science Project: **Sales Performance Analysis and Forecasting**

**Objective:**  
You are working as a Data Scientist for an e-commerce company. Your task is to analyze the companyâ€™s historical sales data, provide detailed insights, and create visualizations for the executive team to make strategic business decisions. In addition, you are required to forecast future sales trends for the next quarter.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset consists of historical sales data for the past two years and includes the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of the sales transaction.
- `Product_ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Category`: Product category.
- `Subcategory`: Product subcategory.
- `Region`: The geographic region where the sale was made.
- `Sales_Amount`: The revenue generated from the sale.
- `Cost`: The cost associated with the sale.
- `Quantity_Sold`: Number of units sold.
- `Discount`: Any discount applied to the sale.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Convert date columns into proper datetime format.
   - Handle outliers in sales and cost values.
   - Create new features (e.g., profit margin, discount rate).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Provide a breakdown of total sales by region, product category, and subcategory.
   - Show monthly sales trends and seasonality.
   - Analyze the relationship between discounts and quantity sold.
   - Identify the top 10 best-selling products and least-selling products.
   - Provide insights on profit margins by region and category.

3. **Data Visualizations:**
   - Visualize sales trends using time series plots.
   - Create bar plots or heatmaps to show sales performance by region, category, and product.
   - Use pie charts or tree maps to illustrate the market share of different product categories.
   - Include an interactive dashboard (optional) using tools like Plotly or Dash for dynamic data exploration.

4. **Sales Forecasting:**
   - Use time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM to predict sales for the next quarter.
   - Compare the performance of different models using evaluation metrics like RMSE or MAE.
   - Present the confidence interval for the forecast to highlight potential uncertainty in predictions.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Summarize key findings and insights in a report.
   - Highlight areas where the company can improve, such as regions with declining sales or categories with high discounts but low profit margins.
   - Provide visualizations and interactive elements (if applicable) to enhance the presentation for the executive team.
   - Recommend actionable strategies based on your analysis, such as potential changes in pricing, inventory management, or promotional strategies.

**Deliverables:**
- A Jupyter Notebook with all data analysis, visualizations, and forecasting models.
- A polished report (e.g., PDF or PowerPoint) summarizing the insights, visualizations, and recommendations.
- (Optional) An interactive dashboard for further exploration of the sales data.

This project simulates a real-world task where mid-level Data Scientists are expected to work on sales performance analysis, provide visual insights, and build predictive models.
